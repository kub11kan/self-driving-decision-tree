Introduction
The Self-Driving Decision Tree project models and predicts driving behavior for self-driving cars using machine learning techniques. By training a Decision Tree Classifier on labeled data, this project provides insights into how autonomous vehicles make decisions based on various driving parameters.

Features
Train a Decision Tree Classifier on labeled driving data.
Evaluate model performance using training and validation datasets.
Visualize the decision tree structure to understand decision-making processes.
Implement and test on real or simulated driving datasets.
Usage
Training and Evaluation
Prepare Data:

Ensure your training and validation datasets (labels_train.csv and labels_val.csv and labels_trainval.csv) are in CSV format and contain appropriate data.
Run Model Training:

bash
Code kopieren
python self_driving_car_predictions.py
This script will output training accuracy and validation accuracy metrics.

Model Visualization
Install Graphviz:

bash
Code kopieren
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install graphviz

# For macOS
brew install graphviz
Generate and View Decision Tree:

bash
Code kopieren
dot -Tpng Self_Driving_Car_Predictions.dot -o self_driving_tree.png
Open self_driving_tree.png to visualize the decision tree structure.

Results
The model achieved the following accuracies:

Training Accuracy: 99.89728562149751%
Validation Accuracy: 85.3512339826906%
